basic coding.
4-10. Slices: Using one of the programs you wrote in this chapter, add several
lines to the end of the program that do the following:

Print the message, The first three items in the list are:. Then use a slice to
print the first three items from that programâ€™s list.

Print the message, Three items from the middle of the list are:. Use a slice
to print three items from the middle of the list.

Print the message, The last three items in the list are:. Use a slice to print
the last three items in the list.

4-12. More Loops: All versions of foods.py in this section have avoided using
for loops when printing to save space. Choose a version of foods.py, and
write two for loops to print each list of foods.
